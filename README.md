## Problem 1 (4 Points)

Consider the following pseudo code.

```scala
 1: def main () {
 2:   var a: Int = 1
 3:   var b: Int = 2

 4:   def middle () {
 5:     var b: Int = a

 6:     def inner () {
 7:       println(a); println(b)
 8:       var a: Int = 3
 9:     }
       
10:     var a: Int = 3

11:     inner()
12:     println(a); println(b)
13:   }

14:   middle()
15:   println(a); println(b)
16: }
```

Suppose this was code for a language with the declaration-order rules
of C (but with nested subroutines) - that is, names must be declared
before use, and the scope of a name extends from its declaration
through the end of the block. At each print statement, indicate which
declarations of `a` and `b` are in the static scope. What does the
program print when `main` is executed assuming static scoping (or will
the compiler identify static semantic errors)?  Repeat the exercise
for the declaration-order rules of C# (names must be declared before
use, but the static scope of a name is the entire block in which it is
declared).

## Problem 2 (4 Points)

Consider the following pseudo code:

```scala
var x: Int // global variable

def set_x(n: Int) {
  x = n
}

def print_x () {
  println(x)
}

def first () {
  set_x(1)
  print_x()
}

def second () {
  var x: Int
  set x(2)
  print_x()
}

def main () {
  set_x(0)
  first()
  print_x()
  second()
  print_x()
}
```

What does this program print when `main` is executed if the language
uses static scoping? What does it print with dynamic scoping? Why?


## Problem 3 (6 Points)

Consider the following fragment of code in C:

```c
{
  int a, b, c;
  ...
  {
    int d, e;
    ...
    {
      int f;
      ...
    }
    ...
  }
  ...
  {
    int g, h, i;
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

1. Assume that each integer variable occupies 4 bytes and that the
   shown variable declarations are the only variable declarations
   contained in this code. How much total space is required for the
   variables in this code when the program is executed?

2. Recall that the values of local variables for each call to a
   subroutine are stored on the stack in a stack frame (aka activation
   record). The compiler assigns to each local variable of the
   subroutine a static offset that determines the variable's location
   in the stack frame relative to the stack pointer that points to the
   beginning of the stack frame. Thus during the execution of the
   call, the value of each local variable can be accessed by adding
   its fixed static offset to the current value of the stack pointer.
   
   Describe an algorithm that a compiler could use to assign stack
   frame offsets to the variables of arbitrary nested blocks of a
   subroutine, in a way that minimizes the total space required to
   store the values of these variables in the stack frame.

## Problem 4 (6 Points)

As part of the development team at MumbleTech.com, Janet has written a
list manipulation library for C that contains, among other things, the
following code

```c
typedef struct list_node {
  void* data;
  struct list_node* next;
} 

list_node;
list_node* insert(void* d, list_node* L) {
  list_node* t = (list_node*) malloc(sizeof(list_node));
  t->data = d;
  t->next = L;
  return t;
}

list_node* reverse(list_node* L) {
  list_node* rtn = 0;
  while (L) {
    rtn = insert(L->data, rtn);
    L = L->next;
  }
  return rtn;
}

void delete_list(list_node* L) {
  while (L) {
    list_node* t = L;
    L = L->next;
    free(t->data);
    free(t);
  }
}
```

1. Accustomed to Java, new team member Brad includes the following
   code in the main loop of his program:

   ```c
   list_node* L = 0;

   while (more_widgets()) {
     L = insert(next_widget(), L);
   }
   
   L = reverse(L);
   ```

   Sadly, after running for a while, Brad's program always runs out of
   memory and crashes. Explain what's going wrong.

2. After Janet patiently explains the problem to him, Brad gives it another
   try:

   ```c
   list_node* L = 0;

   while (more_widgets()) {
     L = insert(next_widget(), L);
   }
   
   list_node* T = reverse(L);
   
   delete_list(L);
   
   L = T;
   ```
   
   This seems to solve the insufficient memory problem, but where the
   program used to produce correct results (before running out of
   memory), now its output is strangely corrupted, and Brad goes back
   to Janet for advice. What will she tell him this time?
